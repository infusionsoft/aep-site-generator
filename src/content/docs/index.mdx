      AEPs are built on proven lessons from industry veterans at Google, Microsoft, Roblox, IBM (and others!) plus major contributors to HTTP and IETF specifications.

      Learn from their experience in crafting APIs that are easy to use, maintain, and evolve.

      APIs that conform to the AEPs can take advantage of our Terraform provider, UI, CLI, and MCP server with zero-configuration.
      The AEPs were designed with a wide variety of clients in mind, not just curl.
