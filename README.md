# AEP Site Generator

## Overview

The AEP Site Generator takes in all of our documentation from multiple
repositories and generates the AEP website.

The site generator is made of multiple parts:

- A CI workflow
- A generator script that reads the various repos + converts their
  documentation to formats supported by Starlight
- A (very standard) [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) website.

## Generator

The generator script reads documentation from all of the repos and writes files
for Starlight to read.

At a high level, the generator script writes out Markdown / MDX (Markdown with
React added) files to src/content/docs for Starlight to read. It also generates
various JSON files in generated/ to build the sidebar and other config.

â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
